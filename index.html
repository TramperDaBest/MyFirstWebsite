    <h1>This is the title. It is h1</h1>
    <h2>These are sections or subtitles. They are h2</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph. It is for normal text.</p>
    <div class="MainContent">

        This is a paragraph inside a div. It is a section for text that you can
        easily access in CSS. Classes also help. This paragraph is in a div
        class called MainContent. You can add an image in a paragraph as well.
        <img
          src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KIKM7NKFQbR2LGct9F9BgQHaHa&pid=Api"
          alt="Yummy apples. "
        />
        This text is after the image. If an image cannot be loaded, it will show
        a small icon and display it's alt text. It shows up on some websites,
        and this is why. For example, this is what it shows:
        <img
          src="https://www.weired-website.com/This-link-will-not-show-an-image"
          alt="Yummy Apples. "
        />
        To make a word or phrase <strong>Bold</strong> with "strong" and a word
        or phrase <em>italicised</em> with "em". You use the "a" tag to make a
        link. For example, here is a link to
        <a href="https://www.ecosia.org">Ecosia</a>.
      </p>

      <!-- A block element will take up an entire row, and an in line element will only take up the necessary space. -->

      <!-- Strong makes it bold and em makes it italicised. -->

      <!-- You can add an image into a paragraph with img src= alt=. -->
    </div>

    <!-- Secondary headings are slightly smaller and less important -->
    <!-- There are h1 to h6 headings -->
